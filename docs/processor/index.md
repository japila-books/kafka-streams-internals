# Processor API

**Processor API** is a low-level API for developers to define topologies in Kafka Streams (mostly when [High-Level Streams DSL](../kstream/index.md) would not meet expectations).

Processor API comes with the following low-level stream processing abstractions:

* [Processor](Processor.md)
* [ProcessorContext](ProcessorContext.md)
* [ProcessorSupplier](ProcessorSupplier.md)
* [Punctuator](Punctuator.md)
