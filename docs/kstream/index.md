# High-Level Kafka Streams DSL

**Kafka Streams DSL** (_KStream DSL_) is a high-level API for developers to define topologies in Kafka Streams.

The entry point to the KStream DSL is [StreamsBuilder](../StreamsBuilder.md).

Main abstractions (for Kafka Streams developers):

* [Consumed](Consumed.md)
* [GlobalKTable](GlobalKTable.md)
* [KStream](KStream.md)
* [KTable](KTable.md)
* [Materialized](Materialized.md)
* [Produced](Produced.md)
* _others_
